"""
This is the start of the global Linear Least Squares Approximation module.
Take one of the Discrete Least Squares Approximation methods below and incorporate
it into the codebase. Only implement one of the approximation methods.

Discrete Least Squares Approximation methods:
1. XTX|XTY method

2. A|b⃗  method

3. Pre-solved version of the A|b⃗  method
